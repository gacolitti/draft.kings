# Overview

`draft.kings` makes it easy to pull data from DraftKings and optimize your lineups. You
can get current contests, fetch draftable players for each contest, and list contest participants
and their points for each contest. There are also functions to facilitate lineup optimization using
DraftKings player projections or your own player point predictions. If you use
DraftKings and know R, this package is for you.

The functions contained in this package wrap
any endpoints I was able to find by inspecting the Draft Kings website. The DraftKings public API 
is undocumented. If you find an endpoint not included in the package, please open an issue.

### Installation

You can install the development version of draft.kings from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("gacolitti/draft.kings")
```

```{r}
library(draft.kings)
```

# Examples

## Contests

```{r}
dk_get_contest_info(contest_key = 133645678)
```

## Draft Groups

```{r}
dk_get_draft_group_info(draft_group_id = 75284)
```

## Leaderboard & Entries

```{r}
dk_get_leaderboard(contest_key = 133645678)
```

```{r}
dk_get_entries(draft_group_id = 80584, entry_keys = c(3618408508, 3618897002))
```

## Lineup Optimization

```{r}
# prepare schematic with contest rules and DraftKings player projections
schematic <- dk_prepare_schematic(draft_group_id = 80584)

# run optimization
optimized_lineup <- dk_optimize_lineup(schematic)

# extract solution
dk_extract_solution(optimized_lineup)
```
